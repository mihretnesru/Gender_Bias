# Gender_Bias
This Python program will basically classify job descriptions as masculine or feminine bias. Selecting a set of words from job descriptions as masculine and feminine bias, I tried to find the probability of each word in a job description and classify it as masculine or feminine bias. We have a data.csv file that has a list of job descriptions to test our model.
